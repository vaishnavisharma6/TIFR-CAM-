# Codes written during internship at CAM in summer of 2022.
1. Code for solving 2-point boundary value problems using FDS and then error analysis using convergence matrices.
2. Algorithm for solving a system of equations that can be converted to a tri-diagonal matrix using Gaussian elimination and then upgrading the algorithm to system of such matrices using LU decomposition.
