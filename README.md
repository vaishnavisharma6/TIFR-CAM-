# Codes written during internship at CAM in summer of 2022.
1. bvp_mixed_bc.ipynb: Code for solving 2-point boundary value problems using Finite difference method and then error analysis using convergence matrices.
2. Linear_system_solution.ipynb: Algorithm for solving a system of equations that can be converted to a tri-diagonal matrix using Gaussian elimination and then upgrading the algorithm to system of such matrices to be solved using LU decomposition.
